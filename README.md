### 👨‍🚀🌎🚀 From Cockpit to Code

I'm a **Data Scientist** with academic foundations in **Aeronautical Sciences** and a degree in **Systems Analysis and Development**. I specialize in extracting meaningful insights from data and transforming complex problems into efficient, data-driven solutions.

Before fully transitioning into the Data Science field, I graduated from an aviation academy and built a solid career in aviation. Years of operating in high-stakes, detail-critical environments trained me to think with precision, act with discipline, and approach problems with a systems-oriented mindset — qualities I now bring to every line of code and every solution I design.

Today, I apply that same mindset to **data analytics**, **machine learning**, and **end-to-end data pipelines** that generate impact across technical and operational domains.
